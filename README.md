# Sales and Revenue Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves designing and analyzing a relational database for a **Sales and Revenue Analysis** system. The database is structured to manage customers, orders, products, payments, shipping, and suppliers to provide comprehensive insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product demand. The SQL queries cover basic to advanced SQL concepts and data analysis, helping generate valuable business insights.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze sales data and generate insights.
- Manage customer, order, product, and payment information efficiently.
- Implement data integrity through relational models.
- Perform revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and product stock management.
- Use advanced SQL concepts like joins, subqueries, CTEs, stored procedures, triggers, and transactions.

## Features
- **Customer Management**: Track customer details and segment them based on purchase history.
- **Order Tracking**: Monitor all orders placed, along with order details and product availability.
- **Payment Management**: Track customer payments and order statuses.
- **Revenue Analysis**: Analyze total sales, revenue per product, and revenue per sales channel.
- **Inventory Management**: Manage stock availability and update it dynamically after each order.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Classify customers based on their purchase amounts.
- **Data Integrity**: Enforce foreign key constraints and use triggers to update stock availability.
  
## Database Schema
The database consists of the following tables:
- **Customers**
- **Orders**
- **Order_Details**
- **Products**
- **Suppliers**
- **Payments**
- **Shipping**
- **Regions**
- **Customer_Segment**
- **Discounts**
  
## SQL Concepts Covered
1. **Basic Queries**: SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT
2. **Joins**: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, SELF JOIN
3. **Subqueries**: Nested queries for complex data retrieval.
4. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Simplify complex queries and improve readability.
5. **Aggregations**: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN
6. **Transactions**: Safely manage multiple SQL operations.
7. **Stored Procedures**: Modularize business logic within the database.
8. **Triggers**: Automate stock updates after each order.
9. **Indexing**: Improve query performance by indexing frequently searched columns.
10. **Data Analysis**: Perform customer segmentation, calculate total revenue, and analyze sales channels.
  
## Example SQL Queries
Here are some key SQL queries executed in the project:

- Retrieve customers and their total order values:
  ```sql
  SELECT c."Customer_Name", COALESCE(SUM(o."Order_Amount"), 0) AS "Total_Orders"
  FROM "Customers" c
  LEFT JOIN "Orders" o ON c."Customer_ID" = o."Customer_ID"
  GROUP BY c."Customer_Name";
  ```

- Find products that have been ordered more than their stock availability:
  ```sql
  SELECT p."Product_Name", SUM(od."Quantity") AS "Total_Ordered", p."Stock_Availability"
  FROM "Products" p
  JOIN "Order_Details" od ON p."Product_ID" = od."Product_ID"
  GROUP BY p."Product_Name", p."Stock_Availability"
  HAVING SUM(od."Quantity") > p."Stock_Availability";
  ```

- Stored Procedure to retrieve a customer’s details:
  ```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE get_customer_by_id(P_Customer_ID INTEGER)
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  AS $$
  BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM "Customers" WHERE "Customer_ID" = P_Customer_ID;
  END; $$;
  ```

- Trigger to update stock after an order:
  ```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_stock_after_order()
  RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
  BEGIN
    UPDATE "Products"
    SET "Stock_Availability" = "Stock_Availability" - NEW."Quantity"
    WHERE "Product_ID" = NEW."Product_ID";
    RETURN NEW;
  END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

  CREATE TRIGGER trigger_update_stock
  AFTER INSERT ON "Order_Details"
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_stock_after_order();
  ```

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-revenue-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sales-revenue-analysis
   ```
3. Set up the PostgreSQL database using the provided schema file (`schema.sql`).
4. Load initial data into the database using the provided data insertion scripts (`data_inserts.sql`).

## How to Use
1. Execute the SQL queries in a PostgreSQL environment to perform sales and revenue analysis.
2. Customize the SQL queries to meet specific business needs.
3. Run the stored procedures and triggers to automate business logic.
4. Use transactions for handling order and payment updates safely.

## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Analytics**: Add predictive analytics on customer lifetime value and sales forecasts.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement advanced indexing strategies for faster query execution.
- **Reporting**: Generate dynamic reports for sales and revenue analysis.
